I publish exclusively to my popular newsletter, [The Sunday Dispatches,](/) once a week. Some of those articles appear below a few weeks later.

### [Dear FNAME, newsletter personalization isn’t what you think it is](/)

Personalization is more than just adding “Hello FNAME” to the start of your emails.

### [There is a war going on for your mind](/)

What we can do is act in spite of these negative feelings. We can take those fears, those worries, those doubts and move forward anyway.

### [Launching is a full-contact sport](/)

You can suit up in protective gear, you can make a game plan, you can even have a great coach. But at the end of the day, the only way to see how things will play out is to get out onto the field and play.

### [Happiness and gravy](/)

I expect very little from anything I do.
