I hesitated to publish all the books I own because I own a lot and because I wasn't sure how to best categorise them. I'm also uncomfortable recommending
books generally because I think a lot of what makes a good book for *you* is when you read it. For example, its been my experience that the order in which you read
*The Fountainhead* and *Atlas Shrugged* determines which one you will like more. The Bible meant nothing to me during my childhoold and early twenties
until I experienced several personal tragedies and humbled out a lot. I'm not a fan of Ryan Holiday's wildly successful books on Stoicism and I think part of it is to do with
the fact that I had already read Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, Epictetus, and Montaigne before I ever knew who Ryan Holiday was, but I can understand how
somebody who has never read the Stoics would find those books incredible.

I digress. I just wanted to explain my thinking on books and book lists a bit before I start the laborious process of writing them all out. Obviously
this won't be a static list. I'll add to it as I buy more books but I won't subtract if I get rid of one. Also, you'll probably see some books
on here that shock and offend you. That's not a feeling I relate to at all. I enjoy reading books, reviewing, and achiving books I can't agree with, and I 
don't think reading or owning an immoral book makes you an immoral person. To the contrary, many of my favorite people in my life have plumbed the truly dark
places of the human mind and come out better and more interesting for it. How many moral beliefs could you reasonably justify if you were asked to explain them? How many historical events
or narratives that you accept as fact could you actually personally prove if asked to do so? Reading ideas outside The Cathedral is at the very least
a fun and useful exercise in testing your ability to respond intelligently to the absurd, the reactionary, the fringe, the cringe, or the downright the wicked. I promise you,
like me, will find that ability lacking. 

So read more! Read books you're scared to read! Read books you can only get used on eBay! Read books you'd hide from your shelves when your friends visit! And send me a note if this list has helped you or if you have any recommendations for me. I'm especially looking for "lost" books that can't be easily found on Amazon, eBay or Project Gutenberg, or wonky self-published books by unknown authors.
