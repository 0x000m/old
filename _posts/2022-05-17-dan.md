title: Dan Held is a big giant dummy head

**1/ Satoshi’s Vision™ is a silly endeavor, as it doesn’t matter what it was, we are where we are now. However, those pushing the “Bitcoin was first made for payments” narrative insist on cherry-picking sentences from the white paper and forum posts to champion their perspective.**

Accurate history of events an ideas is only silly to people who have an interest in being innaccurate. I'm glad you mentioned
"cherry-picking" because I'm have a lot to say about that.

**2/ The following tweetstorm is a categorical repudiation of this tired narrative. Bitcoin was purpose-built to first be a Store of Value (SoV), a thread:**

Only if you are a dunderhead or a liar.

**3/ How do we determine Satoshi’s intention? We need to look at his ideology, description of functionality/architecture, timing, and audience. Let's start with how Satoshi describes the problem Bitcoin solves. In his first public comms after the whitepaper, in the first paragraph:**

This is probably the only correct thing you're going to say in this entire thread.

**4/ “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.” - Satoshi**

You don't get to complain about cherry-picking when you don't include the full quote, Danny. Satoshi goes on to say *"Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible."*

**5/ He later expands on that Libertarian thought in his other writings: “[with Bitcoin] we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.” — Satoshi Nakamoto**

We don't know what Satoshi's politics were. Wei Dai, who was cited in the whitepaper (we'll get to that), said this: "I'm not sure Satoshi would even consider himself a crypto-anarchist." Satoshi almost never discusses politics or government. In one case, he complained about activists from WikiLeaks using Bitcoin and said Bitcoin DOES NOT exist outside grasp of governments. 

Read the Cypherpunk Mailing List archives then compare them to Satoshi. There's no comparison. Timothy C. May signed many of his emails with instructions for making pipe bombs and said he hoped a suitcase nuke would be dropped in Washington D.C. 

As Mike Hearn wrote, "the introduction to Satoshi's paper is not a political manifesto, it talks about the problems of accepting credit card payments online. To the extent that he cared about politics he was interested in the power of the banks and inflationary policies."

**6/ How does Satoshi describe Bitcoin? His forum posts provide insight through his consistent gold/metal analogy: “Bitcoin [is] more like a collectible or commodity.” - Satoshi**

He doesn't say anything about gold or metal here. He's responding to the claim that Bitcoin is like a stock. He's merely noting that it doesn't pay dividends now or in the future. 

And the gold analogy is just silly. It wouldn't mean that Bitcoin was designed only for larger payments. Satoshi has no problem using the term "gold" in refernece to micropayents: "Interestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of spam called "dusting".  Spammers send a tiny amount of gold dust in order to put a spam message in the transaction's comment field."

**7/ "In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases” - Satoshi**

You need to stop cherry-picking quotes and look at the full context. When Satoshi discusses gold, he talks about it as a medium of exchange, which it was for thousands of years. "Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange. I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin. The utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used."

Here is the rest of the quote in question that you left out:  "indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that. In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value."

The comparison to gold is incidental to the design. Satoshi fixed the supply of the money because there was no other way he could think of to solve the problem he was working on without trust. It's also worth pointing out that it's not quite clear if Satoshi understood the value potential of Bitcoin when he first launched it. It seems possible he only fully considered this after people told him. "Hal sort of alluded to the possibility that it could be seen as a long-odds investment."

**8/ “As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: [not useful/no utility]. And one special, magical property: can be transported over a communications channel” - Satoshi**

Sigh. This is starting to get boring Dan. You *really* need to stop cherry-picking. The entire quote includes: "If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it. Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you’ve suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange. (I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it."

Satoshi here literally says the reason Bitcoin might gain value is because people see its usefulness as a medium of exchange in comparison to other existing media of exchange. 

**9/ “If there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something. (I'm using the word scarce here to only mean limited potential supply)” - Satoshi**

You. Need. To. Include. The. Full. Fucking. Quote. Dan. You. Dunderhead.

"I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value. But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something."

Satoshi says the opposite of what you think he says. The sentence you cite is a theoertical example for a world without anything that has properties that make it useful to human ends. In that case, he says, something scarce would still have value. But!!!!! And this is a bigggggggggg BUT! As Satoshi says, in a world with scarcity "an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value."

Intrinsic value is a bad term. Let's be charitable and just assume what Satoshi means is something that has properties that a human will find useful. He means that a Bitcoin that is scarce, and has useful properties, will surely win out over a Bitcoin that is just scarce.

**10/ “It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.” - Satoshi. Satoshi here clearly highlights that Bitcoin’s scarcity gives it value… as a SoV. Limited supply is meaningless for VISA**

He literally compares Bitcoin to VISA though earlier in another post, and in the VERY. NEXT. SENTENCE. of the post you cherry-picked, he and describes the process by which he thinks Bitcoin will catch on...

"Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine."

"...Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices."

You need to go to the whiteboard Dan and write "I will not cherry-pick quotes" one hundred times.

**11/ So we now have an idea of Satoshi’s motivations, and how he describes Bitcoin, but what does his timing tell us? Bitcoin’s launch during the 08' financial crisis was not coincidental. Satoshi had been coding Bitcoin for the last 2 years. Let’s look at the sequence of events...**

This sounds like its going to be as scientifically rigorous as Bible Code or Ancient Aliens. "Here we have a perfectly logical explanation...but could there be an...extraterriestrial expalantion?"

**12/ Jan - July: Fed tries to stop the housing bust: Fed bails out Bear Sterns. Paulson explains the need to bail out Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac the two agencies that held or guarantee 50% of the $12T in US mortgages.**

I can play this game too Dan. 

**13/ Aug 18: Satoshi registers http://Bitcoin.org. Sept 15: Lehman Brothers files for bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history ($600B). Sept 17: Investors withdrew a record $144B from their money market accounts. During a typical week, only about $7B is withdrawn.**

- Oct 2006: UIGEA

~ 2007: Satoshi begins working on Bitcoin

~ 2008: Early code has poker game framework

- Oct 10 2008: Lasseters closes

- Oct 31 2008: Bitcoin

**14/ Oct 3: Bitcoin whitepaper PDF likely created. Oct 13: Treasury Secretary Paulson talks with 9 major bank CEOs. The total bailout package ~$2.25T. Oct 21:  Fed lends $540B to bail out money market funds. Oct 31: Satoshi publishes the Bitcoin whitepaper**

The Bitcoin white paper already existed as early as August 2008 because it was sent to Wei Dai without the citations to ask for a date for his paper. That a new title and some edits was given in October mean very little. The substance of the paper was already done.

**15/ With the 2008 financial crisis, trust had been lost in a world that ran on trust. Bitcoin was launched in a time of absolute necessity, Satoshi planted the seed at precisely the right moment. The world didn't need a new VISA, they needed an alternative to banks.**

Meh. Possible. But that would assume he predicted the financial crise. We've already said he began Bitcoin in 2006 or 2007.

**16/ So we now have an idea of Satoshi’s motivations, how he describes Bitcoin, and his timing, what about this initial audience for the whitepaper? How did he market his message?**

How do we know Dan?

**17/ Satoshi crafted the whitepaper as a call to arms for his target audience: the Cypherpunks on the cryptography mailing list. Key components of their ideology are privacy and finality. His message needed to resonate with them as they would have to help him build it.**

The Cryptography Mailing List is hardly a cypherpunk mailing list.

**18/ “Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.” - A Cypherpunk's Manifesto**

Okay but Bitcoin is not anonymous, and Satoshi literally says "we definitinely don't want to lead with anonymous..." I'm not even sure how this is relevant to the "store of value" question. This point is typical of what small blockers do—take something we can all agree on and act like it only applies to the slowest version of Bitcoin possible. But if you want privacy on Bitcoin, you'd want a large privacy set to work with. Billions of tiny transactions split across trillions of inputs and ouputs... This is only possible with cheap fees.

**19/ Many point to this in the whitepaper “peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments” as proof that Satoshi meant for Bitcoin’s main purpose is to disrupt VISA. However, "cash" represents a pseudonymous push payment in contrast to a credit-based system.**

Oh here we go...

**20/ Cash is a bearer asset. Let’s look at the whitepaper with that in mind: “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic [bearer assets] that would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."**

You're just way over-thinking it. People use the word "cash" to refer to a method of payment. Would you like cash or check or credit card?

**21/ Note that the origin of the word “cash” is “caisse” (French) meaning money-box. So cash is by definition store-of-value. Other Cypherpunks had used the word cash in their whitepapers to reflect that functionality, like “HashCASH”, “eCASH”, etc”**

STAHPPPPP. What is more likely? That Satoshi means the common, modern usage of the word "cash," or a word from 17th century French? And Satoshi is probably not a cypherpunk.

**22/ In the other part of the whitepaper sentence the phrase “peer-to-peer” has been used as well against the SoV narrative. Charlie Lee has a great tweet storm that addresses this point of contention:**

Charlie Lee thinks Bitcoin is valuable because it requires a lot of money to mine, and he couldn't find a coconut on coconut island. He had a vested interest in Bitcoin being unscalable so he could shill Litecoin.

**23/ “Bitcoin isn’t “peer-to-peer.” Payments are sent from sender to miners, who record it on a distributed ledger. The recipient receives the payment when it's recorded. BUT, this is facilitated by a p2p network where transactions are broadcasted.” 
@SatoshiLite**

That's not how Bitcoin originally worked at all. You can receive the payment before its recorded. This was the intended design.

**24/ “Lightning network payments, on the other hand, are p2p payments. They are sometimes direct p2p, sometimes indirect p2p. LN payments have to be sent from p2p to get from the sender to the recipient. Both have to be online, just like other p2p networks like BitTorrent”**

You have to settle eventually on the chain, and if fees rise to thousands of dollars, people will be relying on centralised third parties to settle for them. That's not p2p.

**25/ “Bitcoin with Lightning Network more closely fits the Bitcoin whitepaper's title: "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." This is Satoshi's Vision.” - @SatoshiLite**

Non-cognitive.

**26/ He wrote the paper to fit his target audience, but the source code implementation were his product specs. “If the Bitcoin Whitepaper is the Declaration of Independence, the Source Code is the Constitution” -  @pierre_rochard**

Non-cognitive.

**27/ “The functional details are not covered in the paper, but the sourcecode is coming soon.” — Satoshi Nakamoto. Aka the whitepaper was marketing, the important details are coming.**

This doesn't matter.

**28/ In true Cypherpunk fashion, Satoshi’s whitepaper was quickly followed by code release in January 2009. The notion that good ideas need to be implemented, not just discussed, is very much part of the culture of the mailing list.**

Sure. Though its not the Cypherpunk Mailing List. And he wrote code before the whitepaper.

**29/ Just focusing on the whitepaper is a gross misinterpretation, here are the things not described in the whitepaper, but included in the source code or later defined by Satoshi: 21M hard cap, 10 minute blocks, 1 mb block caps.**

**30/ If Satoshi wanted Bitcoin to first be used as a medium of exchange to purchase goods and services, he would have made it inflationary. People don't spend deflationary currencies when they can make the same purchase in infl. curr. There's even a name for It, Gresham’s Law.**

Greshams Law only refers to government money you twat. "Gresham’s law says that legally overvalued currency will tend to drive legally undervalued currency out of circulation."

And Satoshi literally said it would get started as a medium of exchange and that he was working on an ecommerce module. The original code also included rudimentary gambling apps.

**31/ Which is entirely intuitive. Why would any average consumer spend their Bitcoin with the perception that it will be worth more in the future when they can spend their fiat that they KNOW will be worth less?**

People do this all the time. They buy the latest iPhone right when it comes out even though it will be cheaper in a year. You sound like a Keynsian.

**32/ So far that doesn’t sound like he's trying to disrupt VISA now does it? And if that wasn't made perfectly clear, he permanently etched this message into the Genesis Block: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”**

He can be trying to do both. It's not an either-or choice. Satoshi literally talks about disruting VISA.

**33/ To take it a step further, as a subtle jab to central banks, he chose his birthday as the date the US made gold ownership illegal through EO 6102 April 5th. He chose 1975 as his year of birth which is the year when the US citizens were allowed to own gold again**

Maybe but irrelevant. Gold was used as a daily medium of exchange for thousands of years. Trying to erase that and pretend its only ever been held is stupid.

**34/ And finally, why did Satoshi choose to be anonymous if he were just disrupting payments? What he was trying to accomplish was clear, he wanted to build a new backbone for the financial system. Bitcoin isn't merely digital cash, but an alternative to banks.**

Because getting ride of payment intermediaries is revoutionary. Which is why early Bitcoin projects included things like Silk Road, illegal gambling sites, heroin stores and WikiLeaks donations. You. Dunder. Head.

**35/ And how does a new money get created? A new money comes into existence through stages: Collectible, SoV, MoE, and UoA. SoV and MoE aren’t mutually exclusive. It’s about where in the cycle of appreciation we’re in. At maturity, the payment use case finally makes sense.**
