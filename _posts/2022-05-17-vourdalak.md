title: The Family of the Vourdalak
---



The year 1815 had brought together in Vienna all that was most distinguished in terms of European scholarship, brilliant social minds and high diplomatic capacities. However, the Congress was over.


The royalist emigrants were preparing to return definitively to their castles, the Russian warriors to see their abandoned homes again, and a few disgruntled Poles to bring their love of freedom to Krakow to shelter it there under the triple and dubious independence that the prince had arranged for them. Prince Metternich, the Prince of Hardenberg and the Count of Nesselrode.

Like the end of a lively ball, the meeting, once so noisy, had been reduced to a small number of people inclined to pleasure, who, fascinated by the charms of the Austrian ladies, were slow to pack up and postponed their departure.

This merry society, of which I was a member, met twice a week in the castle of Madame the Dowager Princess of Schwarzenberg, a few miles from the town, beyond a little town called Hitzing. The great manners of the mistress of the place, enhanced by her gracious friendliness and the delicacy of her mind, made the stay in her residence extremely pleasant.

Our mornings were spent walking; we all dined together, either at the chateau or in the surrounding area, and in the evening, seated near a good chimney fire, we had fun chatting and telling stories. It was strictly forbidden to talk politics. Everyone had had enough, and our stories were borrowed either from the legends of our respective countries or from our own memories.

One evening, when everyone had told something and our minds were in that state of tension usually increased by darkness and silence, the Marquis d'Urfé, an old immigrant whom we all loved because of his youthful gaiety and in the piquant manner in which he spoke of his former fortunes, took advantage of a moment of silence and spoke:


“Your stories, gentlemen,” he said to us, “are doubtless very astonishing, but it seems to me that they lack an essential point, I mean that of authenticity, because I do not know that any of them has seen with his own eyes the marvelous things he has just narrated, nor that he can affirm the truth of them on his word as a gentleman.


We were obliged to agree and the old man continued, stroking his jabot:

“As for me, gentlemen, I know of only one adventure of this kind, but it is at once so strange, so horrible and so true, that it alone would suffice to strike terror into the imagination of the most incredulous. I was unfortunately witness to it and actor at the same time, and although, ordinarily, I don't like to remember it, I will gladly tell you this time about it in the event that these ladies are willing to tell me. to permit.”


The consent was unanimous. A few timid glances were directed at the truth on the luminous tiles that the light was beginning to draw on the parquet; but soon the little circle narrowed and everyone fell silent to listen to the story of the marquis. M. d'Urfé took a pinch of snuff, sniffed it slowly, and began in these terms:


“First of all, mesdames, I beg your pardon if, in the course of my narration, I happen to talk about my affairs of the heart more often than would be appropriate for a man of my age. But I will have to mention it for the intelligence of my story. Besides, it is pardonable in old age to have moments of forgetfulness, and it will be your fault, mesdames, if, seeing you so beautiful in front of me, I am still tempted to believe myself a young man. I will therefore tell you without further preamble that, in the year 1759, I was madly in love with the pretty Duchesse de Gramont. This passion, which I then believed to be deep and lasting, gave me no rest day or night, and the Duchess, as pretty women often do, delighted in her coquetry to add to my torment. So much so that, in a moment of vexation, I came to request and obtain a diplomatic mission from the hospodar of Moldavia, then in negotiations with the cabinet of Versailles for matters which it would be as boring as useless to report. The day before my departure, I presented myself at the Duchess. She received me with a less mocking air than usual and said to me in a voice pierced with a certain emotion:”


“D’Urfé, you are doing a great folly. But I know you and I know that you will never reconsider a resolution taken. So, I only ask you one thing: accept this little cross as a pledge of my friendship and carry it with you until your return. It is a family relic to which we attach great value.”

With perhaps misplaced gallantry, at such a moment, I kissed not the relic, but the charming hand that presented it to me, and I put around my neck the cross that here is and that I have never left since. .


“I will not tire you, mesdames, of the details of my journey, nor of the observations I made about the Hungarians and the Serbs, that poor and ignorant people, but brave and honest and who, enslaved as they were by the Turks, had forgotten neither his dignity nor his former independence. It will suffice to tell you that having learned a little Polish during a stay I had made in Warsaw, I soon became acquainted with Serbian, because these two idioms, as well as Russian and Bohemian, are not , as you probably know, as many branches of one and the same language called Slavonic.”


Well then, I knew enough to make myself understood, when one day I arrived in a village whose name would hardly interest you. I found the inhabitants of the house where I stayed in a state of consternation which seemed to me all the more strange since it was a Sunday, a day when the Serbian people customarily indulge in various pleasures, such as dancing, shooting arquebus, wrestling, etc. I attributed the attitude of my hosts to some recent misfortune, and was about to leave when a man of about thirty, of tall stature and imposing face, approached me and took me by the hand.

“Come in, come in, stranger, he said to me, don't be put off by our sadness; you will understand it when you know the cause.”

He told me then that his old father, whose name was Gorcha, a man of restless and intractable character, had risen one day from his bed and had taken down his long Turkish arquebus from the wall.

“Children,” he had said to his two sons, one Dorde, the other Petar, “I’m off to the mountains right away to join the brave men who are hunting this dog Alibek (it was the name of a Turkish brigand who for some time had been devastating the country). Wait ten days for me, and if I don't come back on the tenth, have me say a death mass, because then I'll be killed.”“But,” added old Gorcha, putting on his most serious air, “if (which God forbid you do) I return after the end of the ten days, for your safety do not let me enter. I command you then to forget that I was your father and to pierce me with an aspen stake, whatever I may say or do, for then I would be only a cursed vourdalak who would come to suck your blood.”

“It is fitting to tell you, mesdames, that the vourdalaks, or vampires of the Slavic peoples, are, in the opinion of the country, nothing else than dead bodies brought out of their tombs to suck the blood of the living. Until then their habits are those of all vampires, but they have another that only makes them more fearsome. The vourdalaks, mesdames, preferentially suck the blood of their closest relatives and their most intimate friends who, once dead, become vampires in their turn, so that it is claimed to have seen in Bosnia and Hungary villages whole transformed into vourdalaks. Father Augustin Calmet, in his curious work on the apparitions, cites frightening examples. The emperors of Germany repeatedly appointed commissions to clarify cases of vampirism. Reports were drawn up, corpses were exhumed and found to be gorged with blood, and they were burned in public squares after having their hearts pierced. Magistrates who witnessed these executions claim to have heard the corpses screaming as the executioner drove a stake into their chests. They made a formal deposition and corroborated it with their oath and signature.”

From this information, it will be easy for you to understand, mesdames, the effect that old Gorcha's words had produced on his sons. Both of them had thrown themselves at his feet and begged him to let them go in his place, but in response he had turned his back on them and walked away, humming the refrain of an old ballad. The day on which I arrived in the village was precisely the day on which the term set by Gorcha was to expire, and I had no difficulty in explaining to myself the anxiety of his children.

They were a good and honest family. Dorde, the eldest of the two sons, with masculine and well marked features, seemed a serious and resolute man. He was married and the father of two children. Her brother Petar, a handsome young man of eighteen, betrayed in his countenance more gentleness than boldness, and seemed the favorite of a younger sister, named Sdenka, who might well pass for the type of Slavic beauty. Besides this undeniable beauty in every respect, a distant resemblance to the Duchesse de Gramont struck me at first sight. Above all, there was a characteristic feature on the forehead which I found in all my life only in these two people. This feature might not appeal at first glance, but we became irresistibly attached to it as soon as we saw it several times.

Either that I was very young then, or that this resemblance, joined to an original and naive spirit, was really of an irresistible effect, I had not talked to Sdenka for two minutes before I already felt for her too lively a sympathy for her that it threatened to change into a more tender feeling if I prolonged my stay in this village.


“We were all gathered in front of the house around a table laden with cheese and bowls of milk. Sdenka spun; her sister-in-law was preparing supper for the children who were playing in the sand; Petar, with affected carelessness, whistled as he cleaned a yatagan, or long Turkish knife. Dorde, leaning on the table, his head in his hands and his forehead worried, stared down the main road and said not a word.”


“As for me, overcome by the general sadness, I gazed melancholy at the evening clouds framing the golden background of the sky and the silhouette of a convent half concealed by a dark forest of pines.”


“This convent, as I learned later, had once enjoyed great fame on account of a miraculous image of the Virgin, which, according to legend, had been brought by angels and placed on an oak tree. But, at the beginning of the last century, the Turks had made an invasion of the country; they had slaughtered the monks and ransacked the convent. All that remained were the walls and a chapel served by a kind of hermit. The latter did the honors of the ruins to the curious and gave hospitality to pilgrims who, going on foot from one place of devotion to another, liked to stop at the convent of the Virgin of the Oak. As I said, I learned all this only afterwards, because that evening I had something quite different in mind than the archeology of Serbia. As often happens when you let your imagination run wild, I thought of the past, of the beautiful days of my childhood, of my beautiful France, which I had left for a distant and wild country.”

“In English usage since about the 19th century the term "convent" almost invariably refers to a community of women, while "monastery" and "friary" are used for men. In historical usage they are often interchangeable, with "convent" especially likely to be used for a friary.”

I was thinking of the Duchesse de Gramont and, why not admit it, I was also thinking of a few other contemporaries of your grandmothers, whose images, without my knowledge, had slipped into my heart following that of the charming Duchess.

Soon I had forgotten both my hosts and their anxiety.

Suddenly Dorde broke the silence.

“Woman,” he said, “what time did the old man leave?”
